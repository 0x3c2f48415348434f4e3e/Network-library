# Network Library
Network Library written in C

# Features (coming)
## Network Communication
- [ ] TCP and UDP socket management: Functions to easily open, configure, close, and manage TCP and UDP sockets.

- [ ] Connection Handling: Tools for accepting and establishing connections for both client-server and peer-to-peer architectures.

- [ ] Non-blocking Sockets: Support for asynchronous socket operations to enhance performance in I/O-heavy applications.

## Address and Name resolution
- [ ] DNS Lookup: Functions to resolve domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.

- [ ] Service Resolution: Translate service names and port numbers, possibly using getservbyname() and getservbyport().

## Data Transmission
- [ ] Data Sending and Receiving: Easy-to-use send and receive functions that handle different data types, including structured data.

- [ ] Broadcast and Multicast Support: Methods to handle multicast groups and broadcast messages efficiently

## Security
- [ ] SSL/TLS Support: Integration with OpenSSL or other libraries to enable encrypted communication.

- [ ] Authentication and Authorization: Mechanisms to authenticate users and authorize actions.

## Protocol implementation
- [ ] Protocol Helpers: Functions to help implement common protocols or even custom protocols more easily.

- [ ] Packet Crafting and Parsing: Tools to build and parse network packets for both standard and custom protocols.

## Error Handling
- [ ] Robust Error Reporting: Comprehensive error reporting that can be easily integrated into user applications.

- [ ] Debugging Support: Features to help developers debug their network code, such as verbose logging and condition checks.

## Network Information Management
- [ ] Interface Listing and Configuration: Functions to list network interfaces and retrieve or set configuration details.

- [ ] Routing Table Access: Methods to access and modify the routing table.

## Performace Optimization
- [ ] Buffer Management: Efficient management of buffers for network data to optimize memory usage.

- [ ] Connection Pooling: Maintain a pool of open connections for reuse to improve performance in client-server communications.

## Utility Functions
- [ ] IP Address Manipulation: Functions for handling and manipulating IP addresses.

- [ ] Network Byte Order Utilities: Easy conversions between host and network byte order.

## Cross platform compatibility
- [ ] Platform Abstraction: Abstract away the specifics of different operating systems to provide a unified interface that works across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- [ ] IPv6 Support: Ensure compatibility with IPv6 in addition to IPv4.

## Event Handling
- [ ] Event Loop Integration: Support for integrating with an event loop (e.g., libevent or libuv) to handle network events asynchronously.

- [ ] Callback Mechanisms: Allow users to register callback functions for various network events.

## Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed documentation for all features, including examples and best practices.

- [ ] Example Applications: Provide sample applications that demonstrate how to use the library for common tasks.

## Testing and Realibility
- [ ] Unit and Integration Tests: Include a suite of tests to ensure the library's reliability and correctness.

- [ ] Stress Testing Tools: Tools to stress test network applications using the library.
